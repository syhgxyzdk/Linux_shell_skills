Ihave mp3 music files all over my file system. I would like to move them into specific directory called /mnt/mp3. So how do you find and move all mp3 files to /mnt/mp3 directory on Linux or Unix-like system?

Simply use the find command. It locates all files and then executes a command to move each mp3 file to /mnt/mp3 directory.
Warning: Backup all your data before you type the following commands.
Step # 1: Finding all your .mp3 files

The following command will just find all your .mp3 files using the find command:
# find / -iname "*.mp3" -print
Where,
/ - Search / root directory
-iname - File name search pattern (case insensitive)
-print - Display name of files on screen
Step # 2: Finding and moving all your .mp3 files in one single pass

Type the following command to find and move all files using mv command to /mnt/mp3 directory:
# find / -iname "*.mp3" -exec mv {} /mnt/mp3 \;
Where,
-exec mv {} /mnt/mp3 \; : Execute mv command. The string '{}' is replaced by the file name. \; ends /bin/mv command.
To just move .mp3 files and not directories, use:
# find / -iname "*.mp3" -type f -exec /bin/mv {} /mnt/mp3 \;
Find all directories having name mp3 and move:
# find / -iname "*.mp3" -type d -exec /bin/mv {} /mnt/mp3 \;
For performance you may need to consider using xargs command:
find / -iname "*.mp3" -type f | xargs -I '{}' mv {} /mnt/mp3
Sp to moves all .mp3 files with special characters in its name such as white spaces try:
find / -iname "*.mp3" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' /bin/mv "{}" /mnt/mp3/
Final solution

Above commands will not maintain sub-directory structure. Try replacing mv with rsync to use the same directory structure on the target directory with the -R option:
find / -iname "*.mp3" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR "{}" /mnt/mp3/
You can also write a script that moves files along with directories. This is also useful tomove all files to mp3 player that has been mounted on /mnt/mp3 directory.
